rbdl_luamodel - load RBDL models from Lua files
Copyright (c) 2012-2015 Martin Felis <martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>

DESCRIPTION

rbdl_luamodel allows to load models that are specified as Lua scripts. Lua
is an open-source light-weight scripting language (http://www.lua.org).

This addon comes with a standalone utility that can show various
information of a lua model such as degree of freedom overview or model
hierarchy. It is located in addons/luamodel/rbdl_luamodel_test. Use the -h
switch to see available options.

Note: this addon is not even remotely as thoroughly tested as the RBDL
itself so please use it with some suspicion.

DOCUMENTATION

The documentation for this addon is built with the RBDL documentation. You
can find it in Modules -> Addon: rbdl_luamodel.

LICENSING

This code is published under the zlib license, however some parts of the
CMake scripts are taken from other projects and are licensed under
different terms.
